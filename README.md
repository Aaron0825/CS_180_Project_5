Each teacher can add courses to their array of courses and then they can add quizzes to those courses. The teacher can then remove quizzes or edit quizzes in specific courses. Any edits or additions of quizzes are rewritten in a quiz file using Course.java's method writeQuizFile. Teachers can also see a student's submission after a student takes a quiz. They can then grade a student's submission by saying how many total points are in a quiz and then assigning a score to each individual question in a quiz based off the students submission. This then writes a file using Student.java in order for students to see their grades. |
| Student     | Allows the user to log in to their student account or create a student account. Once the user logs in, the user has two options: course selection or delete account. The delete Account is self explanatory; however, course selection shows you the courses that the user is enrolled in. The user then can select a course and the course will pull up a list of quizzes pertaining to the course. When the student takes the course, they take the quiz and after the user is finished, the program will show the time stamp, if they successfully submitted or not, and the the program will end after that. |
